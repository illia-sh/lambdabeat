#+TITLE: Lambdabeat

* Overview

Lambdabeat allows you to ship AWS Lambda metrics (by way of the Cloudwatch API)
to Elasticsearch.

* Configuration and Usage

** AWS: Credentials and Region

Lambdabeat fetches data from the Cloudwatch API. As such, it does not need to be
deployed anywhere in particular, but it does require valid AWS credentials to be
specified either:

1. In an AWS configuration file located at =~/.aws/credentials.=
2. As environment variables (=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= and =AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=.)

See [[https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go#configuring-credentials][here]] for further details regarding credentials.

Additionally, Lambdabeat requires that a default AWS region be set in the
=lambdabeat.yml= configuration file.

** Functions

Simply specify an array of Lambda functions for which you would like to retrieve
metrics in =lambdabeat.yml= like so:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  lambdabeat:
    functions: ["foo", "bar", "baz", "qux"]
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Metrics

Cloudwatch maintains data for these metrics with respect to Lambda:

- =Invocations=
- =Errors=
- =Duration=
- =Throttles=

These are largely self-explanatory, but see [[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions-metrics.html][here]] for details and subtleties.

Lambdabeat fetches and indexes all of these.
** Period and Interval

Unlike many (really, most) other Beats, Lambdabeat's notion of a =period= does
not necessarily determine the timestamps of the events being indexed. Rather, the
Cloudwatch API provides data between two points in time at a given,
user-specified interval. This is configured via the =interval= key in
=lambdabeat.yml=.

Separately, the =period= key specifies how often Lambdabeat itself should run.
As such, the value of the =@timestamp= field for each event is *not* the time at
which Lambdabeat fetched the data; it's the time for which Cloudwatch has
returned data. At query time, this is an unimportant implementation detail. What
matters is that the events indexed into Elasticsearch are timestamped in a
meaningful matter, which they are. It is important, however, to understand the
distinction at /configuration time/.

Note that the value of =interval= *must* be a multiple of 60. Note also that it
only really makes sense for =period= to be greater than or equal to =interval=.

** Backfilling data

If you would like to index data that predates the first invocation of
Lambdabeat, you may do so by passing a the option =-backfill-date= when invoking
lambdabeat. This will fetch and index all data between the given =backfill-date=
and the time at which Lambdabeat begins running.

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  lambdabeat -e -v -backfill-date="2016-06-08T00:00:00.000Z"
#+END_SRC

** Outputs

Lambdabeat currently supports Elasticsearch as an output. Simply provide an
array of hosts in =lambdabeat.yml= like so:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  output:
    elasticsearch:
      hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Lambdabeat introduces no novel infrastructure with respect to outputs.

* Development
*** Requirements

- [[https://golang.org/dl/][Golang]] 1.6
- [[https://github.com/Masterminds/glide][Glide]] >= 0.10.0

*** Build

To build the binary for Lambdabeat run the command below. This will
generate a binary in the same directory with the name lambdabeat.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    make
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Run

To run Lambdabeat with debugging output enabled, run:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ./lambdabeat -c lambdabeat.yml -e -d "*"
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Package

To produce a versioned tarball containing the lambdabeat binary, lambdabeat.yml,
and lambdabeat index template, run:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  make release
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Cleanup

To clean up the build directory and generated artifacts, run:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    make clean
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Clone

To clone Lambdabeat from the git repository, run the following commands:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/github.com/michaelbaamonde
    cd ${GOPATH}/github.com/michaelbaamonde
    git clone https://github.com/michaelbaamonde/lambdabeat
#+END_EXAMPLE
